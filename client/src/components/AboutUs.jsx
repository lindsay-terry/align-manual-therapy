                <p>Ryan Osguthorpe, LMT</p>
                <p>I graduated from Utah College of  Massage Therapy in 2014. Since then I have worked in both the spa & medical setting, where I have had the honor of working on thousands of clients and providing tens of thousands of massages. I'm continually pursuing new modalities so that I can help my clients that suffer from chronic pain and ailments that that go unresolved. This path has lead me to pursue a higher education in the study of Osteopathic Manual Therapy.</p>
                <p>My mission is to create tailored treatments to fit your specific needs and desired outcome. I take the time to listen to what you are experiencing each time you come in. So that together, we can Align your mind and body bringing you  a higher quality of life</p>
